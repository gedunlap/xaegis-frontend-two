# XAegis Sponsorship Portal

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is hosted on:

[Vercel](https://xaegis.vercel.app/) 

and

[Netlify](https://clever-ride-e72a74.netlify.app/post/13)

## App Overview

I intended this project to be a collective of extreme sports athletes in search of sponsorship. The original idea was for users to have an account where they could post images and videos of them participating in there sport. Then potential sponsors would be able to browse the app and look for athletes by sport. I ran into a lot of trouble trying to implement Auth (JWT, Sessions and Firebase) and spent far too much time struggling with each. At this time I do not have Auth functionality.



## CSS Framwork

[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

I've become a very big fan of skeleton over the last two projects due to its mobile resonsiveness out of the box as well as clean/simple designs and ease of use.

## Backend API

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

I created a custom API for use in this app using Ruby on Rails. I really like how simple it is to set up a project. However I found it slightly annoying when needing to go back and change migrations or data needed.

## Frontend

I used create-react-app to create the front end for this project. I am really enjoying React as well. It seems much easier to me to keep organized using components and pages and linking them throughout. As well as the ease of installing whatever packages you may need.

#### Future Notes

I would like to return here to implement the Auth and create an actual user friendly account interface.
